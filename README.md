# Pipelined_arch
In this project, we have designed a 6-staged pipeline processor, IITB-RISC-23
providing an architecture of 26 instructions with 3 different instruction types.
It is a very simple 16-bit computer system with 8 registers, 2 types of memory
namely instruction memory and data memory, 1 ALU to perform arithmetic
and logical operations, 2 adders, 2 sign extenders, and a few MUXs. It should
follow the standard 6-stage pipelines namely instruction fetch, instruction
decode, register read, execute, memory access, and write back. We have
also implemented hazard mitigation techniques like forwarding and stalling
to counter hazards caused by jumps and dependencies.
